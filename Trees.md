# Red-Black Tree
The Red-Black Tree is a method for balancing a binary tree. It comes with further shape invariants, in addition to the existing order invariants
## Shape Invariants
* Every node in the tree is colored red or black
* No red node can have red children
* For any given pack from the root to a leaf, they all have the same number of black nodes
* Every level except (possibly) the bottom level must be completely full
* The bottom level, which may not be completely full, fills up from left to right
