Welcome to the Obsidian vault for CS385 - Algorithms. Here, you'll find my notes, homework solutions, and other ramblings. Initially, I copied the format from the West Point CS385 course webpage, but I've changed some things, and I expect by the time you read this the website will have changed as well. It's still pretty unfinished, but I'll be making changes here and there as I have time. Whatever state you happen to find this in, hope you enjoy.
