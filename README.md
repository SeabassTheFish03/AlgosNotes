Welcome to the Obsidian vault for CS385 - Algorithms. Here, you'll find my notes, homework solutions, and other ramblings. Initially, I copied the format from the [CS385 webpage](https://eecscourses.westpoint.edu/courses/cs385/), but I've changed some things, and I expect by the time you read this the website will have changed as well. Hope you enjoy.
